# Trailing Newline

An extension for [Nova](https://nova.app).

Ensure a single newline at the end of your documents. No more "No newline at end of file" in your Git diffs!

> ❗️ Heads up!
>
> Nova version 6 [introduced a preference](https://nova.app/releases/#v6) making this extension unnecessary.
> Enable **Ensure a trailing newline at the end of files** to ensure a newline at the end of files. Enjoy!

## Activation

This extension automatically ensures a newline before save by default (this can be disabled from the extension preferences)

Additionally, you can use the command from the command palette: `Ensure Trailing Newline`

Use a keyboard shortcut (default: <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>)
